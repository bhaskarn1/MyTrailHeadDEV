        <p>The BaseComponent is used to include the spinner UI component while loading the lightning component.  The BaseComponent contains a spinner that can be styled using the loadingMC class.</p>
        <p>The original intent was to display the spinner over the main page with an opaque background while the component loads. This can be done by adding the appropriate css styling to .loadingMC and .loadingMC:before definitions.</p>
